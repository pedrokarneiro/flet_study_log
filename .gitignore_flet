# This .gitignore version was recommended for Flet Projects.
# The idea is to merge this version with the standard github
# Python .gitignore file to improve it.
#
# The .gitignore files that should be used to be analysed and
# merged with this one:
# 1. https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore
# 2. https://github.com/ndonkoHenri/Flet-Samples/blob/master/.gitignore
# 3. https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/blob/main/.gitignore
