# This .gitignore version was recommended for Flet Projects.
# The idea is to merge this version with the standard github
# Python .gitignore file to improve it.
#
# Explanation:
# __pycache__/, *.pyc → Python cache files
# venv/, .env/ → Virtual environment and environment files
# .flet/, flet_build/ → Flet-generated build artifacts
# .vscode/, .idea/ → IDE-specific files
# dist/, build/ → PyInstaller build outputs

# Byte-compiled / cached Python files
__pycache__/

*.so

# Virtual environment

# Logs and temp files
